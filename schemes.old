Looking at your travel planning schema, I'd recommend a RESTful API structure that follows the natural hierarchy of your data relationships. Here's how I'd structure it:

## Core API Structure

### Trip Management (Top-level resource)
```
GET    /api/trips                    # List user's trips
POST   /api/trips                    # Create new trip
GET    /api/trips/:tripId            # Get trip details
PUT    /api/trips/:tripId            # Update trip
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId            # Delete trip
```

### Nested Resources (Trip-specific)
```
# Flights
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/flights        # List flights for trip
POST   /api/trips/:tripId/flights        # Add flight to trip
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/flights/:id    # Get specific flight
PUT    /api/trips/:tripId/flights/:id    # Update flight
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId/flights/:id    # Delete flight

# Stays
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/stays          # List stays for trip
POST   /api/trips/:tripId/stays          # Add stay to trip
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/stays/:id      # Get specific stay
PUT    /api/trips/:tripId/stays/:id      # Update stay
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId/stays/:id      # Delete stay

# Packing Lists
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/pack           # List pack items for trip
POST   /api/trips/:tripId/pack           # Add pack item
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/pack/:id       # Get specific pack item
PUT    /api/trips/:tripId/pack/:id       # Update pack item (mark done, etc.)
DELETE /api/trips/:tripId/pack/:id       # Delete pack item
```

## Key Design Principles

**1. User Authorization Middleware**
Since all resources are user-scoped, implement middleware that:
- Validates the authenticated user owns the trip
- Automatically filters queries by `userId`

**2. Bulk Operations** (for better UX)
```
PATCH  /api/trips/:tripId/pack/bulk     # Bulk update pack items (mark multiple done)
POST   /api/trips/:tripId/pack/template # Create items from packing template
```

**3. Aggregated Endpoints** (for dashboard views)
```
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/summary       # Trip overview with counts/totals
GET    /api/trips/upcoming              # User's upcoming trips
```

**4. Search & Filtering**
```
GET    /api/trips?search=paris          # Search trips by name
GET    /api/trips/:tripId/pack?done=false # Filter incomplete pack items
```

## Example API Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Middleware to ensure trip ownership
async function validateTripOwnership(req, res, next) {
  const { tripId } = req.params;
  const { userId } = req.user;
  
  const trip = await db.select().from(trip)
    .where(and(eq(trip.id, tripId), eq(trip.userId, userId)));
  
  if (!trip.length) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Trip not found' });
  next();
}

// Example route handler
app.get('/api/trips/:tripId/flights', validateTripOwnership, async (req, res) => {
  const flights = await db.select().from(flight)
    .where(eq(flight.tripId, req.params.tripId));
  res.json(flights);
});
```

This structure provides clear ownership boundaries, intuitive URLs that match your data relationships, and good separation of concerns for each travel planning component.
